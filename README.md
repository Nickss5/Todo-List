# Todo-List Application

This is my very own Todo App! Check it out here ðŸ‘‰ [https://NISHH.ccbp.tech](https://NISHH.ccbp.tech)

I created a simple Todo List, featuring a user interface that allows users to:

- **The stack I'm using**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ReactJs, local storage
- **Add and Edit Todos**: Users can create new tasks and modify existing tasks.
- **Delete Todos**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Todos are saved in local storage, allowing them to persist even after reloading the page.
